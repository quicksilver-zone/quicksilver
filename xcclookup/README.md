# xcclookup

xcclookup is a utility to assemble Quicksilver x/participationrewards MsgSubmitClaim transactions for a user, in response to a REST request.

## Build

xcclookup can be built using the following:

`make build`: build go binary locally
`make build-docker-local`: build go binary locally and copy into container
`make build-docker`: build docker container natively
`make xbuild-docker`: build docker container for linux/amd64 using docker xbuild on a non linux/amd64 host


## Configuration and Installation

A configuration file is specified on the command-line and should contain the following:

```
source_chain: quicktest-1
source_lcd: https://lcd.dev.quicksilver.zone
chains:
  quickgaia-1: http://172.17.0.1:21401
  quickstar-1: http://172.17.0.1:22401
  quickosmo-1: http://172.17.0.1:23101
```

`source_chain` is the chain id of the Quicksilver chain to which submissions are made.
`source_lcd` is the LCD/API endpoint of the Quicksilver chain to which submissions are made. This is used to fetch ProtocolDatas from the Quicksilver chain.
`chains` is a map of RPC endpoints (typically port 26657) indexed by chain id, of the chains that should be checked for assets.

The config file is specified at the command line using the `-f` flag. This is presently the only command line argument.
