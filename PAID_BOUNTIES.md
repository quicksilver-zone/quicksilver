## Preamble
In order to ensure and stimulate equitable growth and a sustainable ecosystem, at Quicksilver we believe that everyone
should receive some sort of compensation for their hard work, if that hard work benefits the ecosystem.
We welcome contributions of all kinds from code, tests, code reviews, documentation changes.
The higher the number of quality eye-balls that we get on our code and products, the better the quality and security of ours and related ecosystems!
The evaluation of a change is the sole discretion of the Quicksilver maintainers and staff.

## Getting started

Please use these steps as a guide to get you started:
- [ ] Read through [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Read and understand our [CODE OF CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [ ] Accept our Contributor License Agreement and agree to bring in only original changes that you have the correct rights to, please do not bring in contributions that contravene our license nor intellectual property not owned by you
- [ ] Read through [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)
- [ ] Read through the [Google Go style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/guide)
- [ ] Read through the open issues
- [ ] Watch out for issues & pull requests that may be labelled "Eligible for Bounty"
- [ ] Read through open pull requests
- [ ] Understand what is accepted as an impactful change
- [ ] Ensure that you try as much to have testable and maintainable code, along with accompanying tests where possible
- [ ] Learn how to reach out for help or discussions with the Quicksilver maintainers, or even just open an issue on Github


## Evaluating the strength of a change
The impact of a change is the tangible effect it has in advancing the goals of the project, improving the state
to make it smoother for the next maintainers and users coming forward. In our audacious goal of making Quicksilver
the premier liquid staking platform and produce tangible effects that then build up the entire Cosmos/Interchain ecosystem.

Contrary to belief, the number of lines of code in a change doesn't necessarily mean it is much more important than a change
with lesser lines of code: clearer directions to setup the chain or onboard users can even be more impactful than a 2,000 line of code; reviewing a pull request and catching bugs before they happen can be very impactful than even new code.

Please aim for original contributions written and owned by yourself that aren't in contravention of intellectual property rights of another individual/organization.


## In scope contributions:
Please think wholesome in your contributions:
- [ ] Documentation updates: please aim for succinct and more precise, accurate documentation to help the next person rather than just hand-picked
- [ ] Code reviews: if your suggestions improve the general state of affairs, catch bugs, help solidify testing, style, security
- [ ] Code contributions: implemented features, fixes for open and unforeseen issues, more rigorous testing, bug fixes

## Out of scope changes
- [ ] Dead code updates: please firstly ensure that the code that you are updating is actually used

## Payment schedule
We settle payments at the end of every month, and ideally we shall reach out directly to you to fill out information and follow our policies that then qualify one for payment.

## Support and community
- [ ] Please reach out to our Quicksilver Discord, Slack, X (formerly Twitter)

## Security issues
Please report all security issues and vulnerabilities to [security@quicksilver.zone](mailto:security@quicksilver.zone)
