**Genesis file:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ingenuity-build/testnets/main/killerqueen/kqcosmos-1/genesis.json

**Seed:** 66b0c16486bcc7591f2c3f0e5164d376d06ee0d0@65.108.203.151:26656

Atoms can be claimed from the `#atom-tap` channel. The tap gives 25 Atoms. 

**Multiple claims in order to 'race to the top' are not permitted. There is ZERO reward for ranking in the kqcosmos-1 set. Offenders will have rewards withdrawn.**

**N.B.** be sure to use the _same_ account seed from killerqueen-1 so we can programmatically link your validators across networks! If you do not your validator will not count toward the appropriate task!
