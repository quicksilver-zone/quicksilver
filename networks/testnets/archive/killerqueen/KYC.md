## Disclaimer 

To be able to claim rewards, Killer Queen particiants need to undertake a KYC process (Know Your Customer) for private individuals, 
or a KYB process (Know Your Business) for legal entities. 

No rewards will be distributed without the completion and approval of the KYC/KYB process.

info and documents.

You will be able to create one session only. If you do not complete the process in one sitting for any reason, all the documents and information
submitted so far will be saved, and you'll be able to pick the process up where you left it off. 

You will not be able to create a new session while another one is still pending.

Please read carefully the instuctions below before starting. The Quicksilver team is not responsible for any failure to complete the process,
