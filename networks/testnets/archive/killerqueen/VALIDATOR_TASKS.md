# Validator Tasks

To earn rewards on the Killer Queen testnet, validators will need to undertake a number of tasks (all named after Freddie / Queen songs, naturally - why waste a good pun?).

New tasks will be released here (and announced on Discord) periodically. The deadline for tasks - unless explicitly advertised otherwise - is the end of the testnet.

As always, points win prizes!
